# Clustering Categorical Data - Exercise  

📌 **About this Project**  
This repository contains my solution to the **"Clustering Categorical Data"** exercise from my Udemy Data Science course. The goal of this project is to explore **unsupervised learning** by applying **K-Means clustering** to a dataset with categorical features.

## **📊 Project Overview**  
Clustering is an essential machine learning technique for grouping data points based on similarity. However, K-Means is primarily designed for numerical data. In this exercise, i adapt K-Means to work with categorical data by using **appropriate preprocessing techniques**.  

✅ **Objective**  
- Preprocess categorical data to make it compatible with K-Means.  
- Implement **K-Means clustering** and analyze its results.  
- Evaluate cluster assignments and interpret their significance.

## **📂 Dataset Details**  
- The dataset contains **categorical attributes** representing different entities.  
- It is structured to allow the exploration of clusters based on shared characteristics.  
- The challenge is to determine **meaningful groupings** without labeled data.

## **🛠️ Tools & Techniques Used**  
🔹 **Pandas** - Data manipulation  
🔹 **Seaborn & Matplotlib** - Data visualization  
🔹 **Scikit-learn** - Clustering implementation   
🔹 **K-Means Algorithm** - Unsupervised learning technique

## **📝 Key Steps in the Notebook**  

1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Load and inspect the dataset
     
2. **Applying K-Means Clustering**  
   - Assign clusters and visualize the results  

3. **Evaluation & Insights**  
   - Compare cluster distributions  
   - Analyze the characteristics of each cluster  
   - Identify real-world applications of categorical clustering
